    after receiving the data from the old system, we need to upload all the members that we received from the query to
    the wix collection and create them as members in the wix members area, the code appears in the file
    "usersMigration.jsw" and the function name is userMigration (There you can see which colleciton to upload the
    members to)
    after the migration is done, the users that were created successfully should be downloaded, (You may see which
    colleciton they are stored in the code in the file "usersMigration.jsw" ).
    now run this script that maps the users that were created (rename the array as "allUsers"), then add them to the
    file allUsersMaped.js (which contains all the users that were created successfully).
-->
<!--Notice! if the member's image filed is not equal to "/img/profile_image.png" so you have to first upload the image to the wix media, add the new id and old id to the array named "allMembersProfileImages"
in the file "usersMigraiton, and only then the migratin can be done."-->
